        <p class="bio">
            My journey started with earning my **Associate's Degree**, where I developed a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. From there, I enlisted in the **U.S. Navy**, where I worked as a **Signal Analyst**, deciphering radar data and managing complex operational systems. This experience instilled in me a meticulous attention to detail and the ability to work under pressure in mission-critical situations.<br><br>
            Transitioning into civilian life, I continued to hone my skills in **data analytics, programming, and operations management**. My role at the **Police Department** has given me extensive experience with **database management, record-keeping, and process optimization**, further strengthening my technical expertise. Simultaneously, I have developed and maintained a **personal blog and digital business**, leveraging **SEO, content strategy, and market analysis** to drive engagement and sales.<br><br>
            Today, I bring a unique blend of **technical, analytical, and creative skills**, allowing me to **optimize processes, develop digital solutions, and craft impactful data-driven strategies**.
