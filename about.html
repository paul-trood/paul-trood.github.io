        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="bio">
            <p>My journey has been anything but conventional, but that’s exactly what gives me an edge. 
            I started with an **Associate’s Degree** in Culinary Arts, which, surprisingly, taught me 
            far more than just cooking—it ingrained in me business fundamentals, **logistics, 
            process optimization, and attention to detail**.
            </p> 
            
            From there, I enlisted in the **U.S. Navy**, where I worked as a **Signal Analyst**. My job? **Deciphering radar 
            signals from raw numerical data** to detect potential threats in real-time. I mastered 
            pattern recognition, high-pressure decision-making, and the ability to **manage complex 
            technical systems under extreme conditions**. Later, I became an **Electronic Warfare Supervisor**, responsible 
            for tactical defense strategies and overseeing advanced military tech. 
            
            Following my service, I pivoted into the world of **data analytics, programming, and 
            operations management**. At the **Greenville Police Department**, I handle **records management, 
            database corrections, and video evidence processing**—essentially acting as the 
            department’s unofficial IT expert. I also manage complex software systems and assist 
            officers with tech-related challenges. 
            
            Meanwhile, I built and ran a **successful digital business**, generating over **$4,500 in sales** 
            through **SEO-driven content, market analysis, and copywriting**. I analyze trends, craft high-performing content, 
            and optimize engagement strategies to maximize conversions. 
            
            I’ve also self-taught **Python, JavaScript, SQL, and Tableau**—leveraging my technical 
            knowledge to **develop dashboards, automate processes, and extract insights from data**.
            Additionally, I’ve built **three gaming PCs from scratch**, troubleshooting both software and hardware 
            issues, further strengthening my problem-solving skills in IT and networking.
            
            My skill set is a unique blend of **data-driven decision-making, operational efficiency, 
            and digital strategy**. I thrive on solving problems, improving systems, and using technology 
            to drive meaningful impact.
